The model allows for explicit specification of 3-10 layers, from coarse layouts to fine-grained details, and supports infinite decomposition.
> **Impact:** This release may impact the development of image editing and generation applications, particularly those leveraging Hugging Face models. The ability to control layering and structure with prompts could lead to more sophisticated and detailed image generation capabilities, potentially disrupting traditional image editing workflows.
