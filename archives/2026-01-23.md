### Scaling WideEP Mixture-of-Experts inference with Google Cloud A4X (GB200) and NVIDIA Dynamo
**Source:** Google Cloud (General)

> **Category:** [AI_INFRA]
> **Summary:** This article discusses the scaling of WideEP Mixture-of-Experts inference using Google Cloud A4X (GB200) and NVIDIA Dynamo. It highlights the benefits of combining Google Cloud's AI infrastructure with NVIDIA's rack-scale acceleration, achieving high-performance instantiation of the AI inference stack. The article provides details on the infrastructure layer (A4X machine series), serving layer (NVIDIA Dynamo), and orchestration layer (GKE), as well as performance validation results.
> **Impact:** The use of A4X and NVIDIA Dynamo can significantly improve the performance of Mixture-of-Experts inference workloads, achieving over 6K total tokens/sec/GPU in throughput-optimized configurations and 10ms inter-token latency in latency-optimized configurations. This can have a major impact on the deployment of large-scale AI models, enabling faster and more efficient processing of complex workloads.
