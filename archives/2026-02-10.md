### I built a rough .gguf LLM visualizer
**Source:** r/LocalLLaMA

> **Category:** [AI_MODELS]
> **Summary:** The author has created a basic tool to visualize the internals of a .gguf LLM (Large Language Model) file in a 3D representation, showing layers, neurons, and connections. The goal is to understand the model's structure instead of treating it as a black box. The author is seeking a more polished version of such a tool, referencing an existing example that cannot upload new LLMs.
> **Impact:** This tool has the potential to enhance the understanding and transparency of LLMs, allowing for better analysis and potentially improving model performance. However, the current implementation is rough and may not be scalable or widely applicable, highlighting the need for a more robust solution.
