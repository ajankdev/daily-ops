### How we cut Vertex AI latency by 35% with GKE Inference Gateway
**Source:** GKE & Containers

> **Category:** [GCP_K8S_CORE]
> **Summary:** The Vertex AI engineering team utilized GKE Inference Gateway to reduce latency by 35% and improve tail latency by 2x. The gateway's load-aware and content-aware routing capabilities allowed for more efficient request routing, resulting in a doubled prefix cache hit rate. The team achieved this by tuning multi-objective load balancing and managing queue depth for bursty traffic.
> **Impact:** The use of GKE Inference Gateway can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of AI workloads on GKE, reducing latency and costs while increasing cache efficiency. This solution can be applied to various AI workloads, making it a valuable tool for platform builders and engineers.

### Starfish Space uses Google Cloud to accelerate satellite servicing in orbit
**Source:** Google Cloud (General)

> **Category:** [GCP_K8S_CORE]
> **Summary:** Starfish Space, a startup, is using Google Cloud to accelerate satellite servicing in orbit by leveraging Google Compute Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to run massive-scale Monte Carlo simulations for training autonomous software. This approach enables them to test their software in a virtual orbital environment, iterate rapidly, and scale compute resources up and down to control costs.
> **Impact:** The use of managed Kubernetes (GKE) allows Starfish Space to execute millions of complex simulations with speed and confidence, reducing the cost of development and accelerating timelines. This infrastructure enables them to deliver capabilities that support critical missions, such as satellite servicing, and demonstrates the power of cloud-based high-performance computing for demanding workloads.
