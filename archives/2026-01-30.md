### Accelerate GKE cluster autoscaling with faster concurrent node pool auto-creation
**Source:** GKE & Containers

> **Category:** [GCP_K8S_CORE]
> **Summary:** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) now supports concurrent node pool auto-creation, reducing provisioning latency and improving autoscaling performance. This feature allows multiple node pools to be created simultaneously, benefiting heterogeneous workloads, multi-tenant clusters, and large AI training workloads. The improvement is available in GKE version 1.34.1-gke.1829001 and later, with no additional configuration required.
> **Impact:** This feature can significantly improve the deployment and scaling speed of GKE clusters, especially for workloads that require multiple node pools. It can also enhance the overall autoscaling responsiveness and resource utilization of GKE clusters, leading to better performance and cost optimization.

### Ingress NGINX retires in March, no more CVE patches, ~50% of K8s clusters still using it
**Source:** r/DevOps

> **Category:** [GCP_K8S_CORE]
> **Summary:** The Ingress NGINX project is retiring in March 2026, which means it will no longer receive security patches, including CVE patches. This affects approximately 50% of Kubernetes clusters that still use it. The maintainers have been seeking help since 2022 but have not received sufficient support, leading to the decision to pull the plug. There is no drop-in replacement, and migration will require significant work.
> **Impact:** This retirement will have a significant operational impact on Kubernetes clusters using Ingress NGINX, as they will be exposed to security vulnerabilities without patches. Cluster administrators will need to plan and execute a migration to an alternative ingress controller to ensure the security and integrity of their clusters.
