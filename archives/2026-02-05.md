### Audits keep pulling senior engineers into work only they can explain
**Source:** r/DevOps

> **Category:** [OPS_STACK]
> **Summary:** The post discusses the challenge of senior engineers being pulled into audit work, specifically explaining configurations, workflows, and edge cases that are not formally documented. This disrupts delivery schedules and makes audits unpredictable.
> **Impact:** The impact on operations is significant, as it takes away valuable time from senior engineers, delaying project delivery and making it difficult to plan ahead. Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, and GitOps practices using FluxCD, can help alleviate this issue by providing a single source of truth for configurations and automating workflows, making audits more predictable and less reliant on individual engineers' knowledge.
