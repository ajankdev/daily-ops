### our ci/cd testing is so slow devs just ignore failures now"
**Source:** r/DevOps

> **Category:** [OPS_STACK]
> **Summary:** The company is experiencing slow and flaky CI/CD testing, with 800 automated tests taking 45 minutes to over an hour to run, and 5-10 tests failing randomly on each run. This has led to developers ignoring test failures, which defeats the purpose of testing. The company has tried parallelizing tests and being more selective about what runs on each PR, but has hit resource limits and misses important issues.
> **Impact:** The slow and unreliable testing process is causing a bottleneck in the QA stage, preventing the company from achieving multiple deploys per day, and potentially leading to undetected issues making it to production, which can have significant operational and reputational impacts.
