### Cloud Deploy with MIGs (Custom Targets) VS A GitOps / Pull-based
**Source:** r/GoogleCloud

> **Category:** [GCP_K8S_CORE]
> **Summary:** The user is evaluating two approaches for a modern CI/CD pipeline on GCP, specifically for Compute Engine VMs, as GKE and Cloud Run are ruled out. The options are: 1) Cloud Deploy with Managed Instance Groups (MIGs) as Custom Targets, and 2) a GitOps/pull-based approach using git events to trigger changes on the VMs. The user seeks advice on the operational overhead and best practices for VM-only CI/CD on GCP.
> **Impact:** The choice between these two approaches will significantly impact the maintainability and "day 2" operations of the CI/CD pipeline, with considerations including complexity, scalability, and manageability.
