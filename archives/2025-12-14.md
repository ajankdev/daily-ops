### How in tf are you all handling 'vibe-coders'
**Source:** r/DevOps

> **Category:** [AI_MODELS]
> **Summary:** The input discusses the challenges of dealing with non-technical employees who claim to be experts in software development and cloud architecture due to the hype surrounding AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs). These employees are producing low-quality code and expecting it to be deployed to production without proper review or understanding of the code's functionality or security implications.
> **Impact:** The situation can lead to security risks, infrastructure integrity issues, and frustration among technical teams responsible for maintaining the organization's systems. It highlights the need for proper governance, oversight, and education on the responsible use of AI and LLMs within organizations.

### Training an LLM only on 1800s London texts - 90GB dataset
**Source:** r/LocalLLaMA

> **Category:** [AI_MODELS]
> **Summary:** The author is training a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch using a 90GB dataset of 1800s London texts, with the goal of reducing modern bias. The model is a LLaMA-style model with 300M parameters, trained to 10K steps, and has already learned long sentence structures but struggles with logical connections. The author plans to train another evaluation model and scale up to a 1.2B parameter model on the full 90GB dataset.
> **Impact:** The project has the potential to contribute to the development of more nuanced and historically accurate LLMs, and the author's approach to addressing bias in LLMs is noteworthy. However, the project's infrastructure and operational aspects are not explicitly mentioned, limiting its direct impact on GCP, K8s, or other operational areas.
