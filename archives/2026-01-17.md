### How Palo Alto Networks built a multi tenant scalable Unified Data Platform
**Source:** Google Cloud (General)

> **Category:** [GCP_K8S_CORE]
> **Summary:** Palo Alto Networks transformed their data processing landscape by partnering with Google Cloud to build a unified multi-tenant platform powered by Dataflow, Pub/Sub, and BigQuery. This migration allowed them to move from a single-tenant architecture with 30,000 individual data pipelines to a shared resource pool, simplifying operations and unlocking new efficiencies. The new platform processes billions of events daily with improved agility, simpler operations, and significant cost savings.
> **Impact:** The migration to Dataflow resulted in around 30% compute cost savings, improved engineering focus on building new analytics features, and reduced alert fatigue. The Unified Data Platform became the standard for real-time data processing across the company, providing a scalable and repeatable blueprint for supporting new product lines without duplicating engineering effort.
