### I'm starting to think Infrastructure as Code is the wrong way to teach Terraform
**Source:** r/DevOps

> **Category:** [OPS_STACK]
> **Summary:** The author is discussing the limitations and potential misconceptions of using Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. They highlight the importance of the state file in Terraform, which can lead to discrepancies between the intended configuration and the actual state of the infrastructure.
